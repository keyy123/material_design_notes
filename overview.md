### Accessibility & Material Design 
- *Accessibility by default* = understanding and preparing app to be easily used by people with various conditions, disabilities, and stages of life. 
- Pros: Saves time and energy from redesign and develop patches and stop 
lawsuits
- Accessibility standards are built into Material components by default
- List of disabilities to consider: Low vision, blindness, hearing impairments, cognitive 
impairments, motor impairments, or situational disabilities (broken limbs, missing limbs),
arthiritic, emotional disturbances

### Get Started
- Material has A11y standards in component areas and guideline.
- In it's components, A11y is added in both the design and code and discussed and communicated in open spaces and determined by team. 


Note: I decided to skip the rest of the section here because I can always come back to it later plus the information was easy to understand.
